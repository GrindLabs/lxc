# GrindLabs LXC Templates

This project contributes LXC helper scripts for quick setup on ProxmoxVE. The goal is to make it easy to bootstrap common containers with a single command.

## Quick start

Run on a ProxmoxVE host:

### vLLM + OpenVINO

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grindlabs/lxc/main/vllm-openvino.sh)"
```
